      <h1>Site Guide</h1>
      <h2>What is this site for?</h2>
      <p>This site is utlimately an archive for all of my written works, enabling me to showcase them so that others might find them useful or interesting in some way.</p>
      <h2>How is this site organised?</h2>
      <p>This site has these four main areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Poetry</li>
        <li>Writings:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Philosophy and Religion</li>
          <li>World</li>
          <li>Miscellany</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Programming:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Haskell</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>MATLAB/Octave</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>All four of these areas are governed by the hierarchy, and naming convention below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Areas</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Sections</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Topic Series</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Entries</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Within the area of Poetry, each poem is considered as an entry. And so, each poem serves as the smallest unit of content in this area.</p>
      <p>The sections within the Writings area each contain topic series, each of which holds a series of entries. Each entry is a single informal essay. All topic series and entries are appended in chronological order.</p>
      <p>The area of Programming contains the programming languages which I have learnt, and wish to learn, as sections. Some sections may not have content within them since I have either not learnt the language yet, or have not had the time to carry out projects within it.</p>
      <p>As the name suggests, all sections within the area of Other are completely random, and such that they do not fit into any of the other areas (as a poem, essay, or programming project).</p>
      <h1>The Nature of My Work</h1>
      <p>I would just like to add a couple of words here about the nature of, and my intentions for, the work which I share on this site:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My primary intention for all of the material here, is that it should ultimately serve some use. Thus, I have no intention of creating works that stir neither mind nor action, no matter how small the stirring.</li>
        <li>I do not intend to hurt others, neither do I intend to be arrogant, or unreasonably judgemental. If you see things that mirror such intentions within my works, then please note that such elements exist in error alone.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, when I write about my thoughts on any given subject, those thoughts only mirror my mindset at the time of writing on those subjects. Therefore, if one were to discovery contradictory views upon one subject, then it is due to a change of my mind. I will be sure to make any such change as explicit as possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To end this site guide, I would also like to say that I hope these works may be of some enjoyment and use.</p>
